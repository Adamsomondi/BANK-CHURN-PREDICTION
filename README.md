# BANK-CHURN-PREDICTION

## Dataset Source

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adammaus/predicting-churn-for-bank-customers

## Description

This project leverages bank customer churn dataset and classification machine learning techniques to accurately predict customer churn, enabling proactive decision-making and improved customer retention
The project goal is to use this model to help the bank to retain its customers since Customers switching from one company to another  makes the company loose revenue.

## Milestone 1

### Data Preprocessing

   <b>a.Data cleaning</b>
   
   Removed and fixed errors(e.g., handling missing values, duplicates, or incorrect data).
   
   <b>b.Data Transformation</b>
   
   Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features.
   
<b>c.Data Quality Handling</b>
   
   Detected and resolved outliers, ensuring consistency in data.

  ### Exploratory Data Analysis
  
<b>a.Descriptive Statistics</b>

Computed summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) to understand the data distribution.

<b>b.Data Visualization</b>

Used histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to explore trends, distributions, and relationships.

## Milestone  2

### Step 3.Data Modelling

<b>a. Model Selection & Training</b>

Machine learning Model -Logistic Regression.

Split data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split).

Trained models on the dataset using appropriate hyperparameters.

<b>b. Model Evaluation & Optimization</b>

Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Performed hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV).

Used cross-validation to assess model stability.
